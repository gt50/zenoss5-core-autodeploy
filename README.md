```

**User feedback:**

> I tried to use your script to deploy zenoss 5 and docker wont start. I'm very disappointed. 

I agree. This script is not magic Unicorn, which will solve all Zenoss 5 deployment problems 
(wrong filesystems types, not compatible OS, ...). That's the reason, why script prints 
link to [manual installation guide](http://www.zenoss.com/resources/documentation), which is your safe option for Zenoss 5 installation.

The script will take several minutes (around 15-30) to complete. When done, 
you should be able to visit Control Center in a web browser to start 
Zenoss 5 application. Easy Zenoss installation.

![Zenoss 5 Core - Start of installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monitoringartist/zenoss5-core-autodeploy/master/doc/zenoss5-video-installation.gif) 

Script requires mounted filesystems:

```
/var/lib/docker 
/opt/serviced/var
/opt/serviced/var/volumes
/opt/serviced/var/backups
```

Or you can pass a block device for automatic formatting and mounting of required 
filesystem(s). Confirmation is needed before formatting. Available options:

```
# ./core-autodeploy.sh -d </var/lib/docker block device> -s </opt/serviced/var block device>
 -v </opt/serviced/var/volumes block device> -b </opt/serviced/var/backups block device>

# ./core-autodeploy.sh -d /dev/sdb1 -s /dev/sdb2 -v /dev/sdc1 -b /dev/sdd1
```
